# World Development Indicators

This repo has two files that I downloaded from the World Bank's [World Development Indicators](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD/1ff4a498/Popular-Indicators#). I primarily use these data for practice wrangling.

Data dowloaded on 2018-09-08.
